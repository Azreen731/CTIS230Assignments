                <h4>Take pictures</h4>
                <p>I take a lot of pictures when I get time. I especially love taking scenery pictures. Some of the pictures I've taken are at the bottom of the page</p>

                <h4>Draw</h4>
                <p>Drawing is something that I'm really good at. I like to experiment with all sorts of mediums, such as acrylics, oil, pastel, and charcoal. </p>
